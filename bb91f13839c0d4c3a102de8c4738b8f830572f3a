I\u0027d left it actually as a 1:1 copy of the previous `cast/filters.json`... this\u0027s now corrected to be cobalts variant like I intended (and the description implies).\n\nalso for the failures: apparently ICU has a preprocess step for the JSON to strip all comments, but they don\u0027t handle whitespace at all, so any comment with whitespace preceeding it will cause a rather opaque syntax failure to be thrown.\n\nis `2024 the chromium project authors` the correct tag to use?",
