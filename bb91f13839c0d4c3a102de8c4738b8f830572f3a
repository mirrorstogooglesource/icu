      "message": "This might be a question for @jshin@chromium.org or @ftang@chromium.org but do we have any guidelines when adding a custom dat file?\n\nI\u0027m worried that this is another OS that needs to be maintained in a repo that isn\u0027t really funded. For context, the responsibility of upgrading ICU has been moved from i18n to a Chromium team a couple of years ago (mainly compromised of volunteers). Upgrading ICU usually comes with API changes and there have been a couple of times already when other consumers blocked or delayed roll out of a new version. \n\nI\u0027m not sure what the right balance is. At a minimum, this seems like we\u0027d need a contact from chromecast_video incase there are issues during upgrade.",
